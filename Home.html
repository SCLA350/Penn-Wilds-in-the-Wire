<h2><a href="Article1.html">ART ADVENTURE: The Naples National Archeological Museum</a></h2>
<p>Naples is remarkable for its fame in international cuisine and its association with Pizza. However, many people worldwide ignore how cardinal
this metropolis has been due to the support in preserving valuable pieces of the Vesuvian era.
Records of the origin of the collection of these pieces relate it to the figure of Charles of Bourbon. He was on the throne of the Kingdom of Naples in 1734.
His cultural policy led him to promote the exploration of the Vesuvian cities buried by the eruption of 79 AD.
This process began in 1738 in Herculaneum, then in 1748 in Pompeii. Likewise, he oversaw the construction of a Farnesian Museum in the city,
transferring part of the rich collection inherited from his mother Elisabetta Farnese from the residences of Rome and Parma.</p>

<h2><a href="Article2.html">CITY DESTINATION: Helsinki Espa</a></h2>
<p>The popular Esplanade Park, fondly referred to as “Espa” among locals, is the most famous park in Finland and the green heart of Helsinki.
People come here to see and be seen, to listen to music and watch performances, and to enjoy picnics. Originally, the principle architect of Helsinki
Carl Ludvig Engel designed the park in an area of low-lying wetland. Locals referred the eastern portion (Chapel Esplanade) to
as “Small Calf Hook” and the central and western portions (Runeberg Esplanade and Theatre Esplanade) as “Large Calf Hook”.
The foul smelling Kluuvi Bay (Kluuvinlahti) extended southwards almost to the Esplanade, so the authorities required a lot of landfill to construct the park in the 1850s.</p>
